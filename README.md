## What's Corewar ?

</br>

The Corewar is the final project of the first year at Epitech, the goal of this project<br>
is to realise a Virtual Machine and an ASM Compiler to compile ***.s*** in ***.cor***,<br>
and we can do some bonus to have better mark<br>

## Our bonus

We decide to add a graphical Virtual Machine to see exactly all the procesus.<br>

## To Finish

To close this module, we have to do a complete presentation of the project and explain how we do this project !</br>
At the end of the presentation we get a third better mark, and in a second time we do a technical review to expose our</br>
code and present all functionality of our project. In conclusion we get a grade from E to A for this module.

        Presentation mark:      4240

        Technical review mark:  14/20

        Grade:                  A
